Hi! I am Ole Bertram, or elomatreb. On this page, I listed the various ways to contact me and the many places where you can look at stuff I made.

I would really love to hear from you!

### Getting in touch

If you want to tell me something or ask me any questions, E-Mail is propably the best way. Please use OpenPGP (GnuPG) if your message contains sensitive details!
<ul>
	<li class="email"><a href="mailto://ole@elomatreb.eu">ole@elomatreb.eu</a></li>
	<li class="pgp">PGP-Fingerprint: <span title="Fingerprint">74E0 B317 4A43 53FF D86E  7EAF 5AE6 943A 31E3 6AEC</span> [ <a href="/files/pgp/public_key.txt">self</a> / <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x5AE6943A31E36AEC">MIT</a> / <a href="https://keybase.io/elomatreb">keybase.io</a> ]</li>
</ul>

If you don't care that your message is public, my [Twitter][twitter] is also a very good option, although I use it mostly to rant about about things.

For Instant Messaging, I don't really use anything besides my [XMPP][xmpp].

Additionally, I also occasionally use [Google+][google+].

### Work

If you want to get an impression of my work, I would recommend viewing my <a href="#/work/" class="disabled">portfolio</a>.

Another useful resource may be my [GitHub account][github], where you can see my contributions to various Open Source software projects.

Besides that, I also have an [account on CodePen][codepen], which I occasionally use to play around with random web technologies.
