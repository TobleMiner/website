[![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/elomatreb/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elomatreb/website)

My personal website, blog and portfolio. Built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

## Development

Once you have cloned the repository, execute `bundle install` to get all 
necessary gems.

Since the SCSS utilizes [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon), it is 
necessary to install the files manually.

```
$ rake setup
```

The `Rakefile` in this repository provides several other useful commands if you 
want to build a local copy of the site.
