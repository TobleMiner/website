title: About Me
---

Hi! I am Ole Bertram, or elomatreb, a 17 year old web designer and developer 
from the north of Germany (Schleswig-Holstein). I love building and designing 
websites, programming, making things work the way I want them to, art of any 
kind, and learning new things in general.

## Contact

If you want to tell me something or ask me any questions, E-Mail is probably 
the best way. Please use OpenPGP (GnuPG) if your message contains sensitive

## Work

If you want to get an impression of my work, I would recommend viewing my 
[portfolio][portfolio] or download my [CV][cv].

Another useful resource may be my [GitHub account][github], where you can see 
my contributions to various Open Source software projects, or maybe my 
[account on CodePen][codepen], which I occasionally use to play around with 
random web technologies.
